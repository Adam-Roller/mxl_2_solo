# mxl_2_solo

Tool to convert MusicXML files to the .gjm formate used by Swords of Legends Online.
Inspired by https://github.com/kieve/solo-gjm

This project was created for a side project to work on in Rust, and is currently functional for basic MusicXml files but does not parse very intelligently, see the issues for known bugs and improvements.
